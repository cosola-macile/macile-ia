MACILE, which stands for Mathematics, Sciences, Engineering, and Language in Spanish, is a language-infused STEM (STEM-L) program that advances engineering and science education in less advantaged communities in the USA, the Dominican Republic, and Latin America.
MACILE is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort with faculty and students from USA colleges and universities, Dominican schools, Dominican universities, private corporations, public agencies, professionals, and community leaders. MACILE is a bilingual program. It was piloted in 2007-2008. It is currently a summer program for educators and students and operates in the Itabo-Nigua region, Dominican Republic (MACILE-DR). A pilot program is slated to begin in 2011 in the USA. 

> Learning [math, sciences, and language] processes that enlarge the youths’ thoughts and challenge their imaginations are essential for scientific and technological advancement and indispensable to break through the cycle of poverty—mental, social, and economical—in marginal [less advantaged] communities. Challenging and stimulating education expands the knowledge frontier and elevates hope.
