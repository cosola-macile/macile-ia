MACILE, which stands for Mathematics, Sciences, Engineering, and Language in Spanish, is a language-infused STEM (STEM-L) program that advances engineering and science education in less advantaged communities in the USA, the Dominican Republic, and Latin America.
MACILE is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort with faculty and students from USA colleges and universities, Dominican schools, Dominican universities, private corporations, public agencies, professionals, and community leaders. MACILE is a bilingual program. It was piloted in 2007-2008. It is currently a summer program for educators and students and operates in the Itabo-Nigua region, Dominican Republic (MACILE-DR). A pilot program is slated to begin in 2011 in the USA. 

> Learning [math, sciences, and language] processes that enlarge the youths’ thoughts and challenge their imaginations are essential for scientific and technological advancement and indispensable to break through the cycle of poverty—mental, social, and economical—in marginal [less advantaged] communities. Challenging and stimulating education expands the knowledge frontier and elevates hope. 
—SC. Vargas, Executive Director, COSOLA

MACILE-DR is an emerging solutions-driven, language-infused STEM (STEM-L) program operating in the region of Itabo-Nigua (Ytabo) in the Dominican Republic (DR) since 2007. This program, designed to advance K–12 engineering and technology education in the DR, is the first of this nature introduced in the country. It is intended to be a model for fostering design of robust and efficient mathematics, science, engineering and language learning environments.

MACILE-DR is a collaborative multidisciplinary and international effort in partnership with Dominican schools, faculty and students from US colleges and universities, private corporations, and public and private organizations from the US and the Dominican Republic.

MACILE-DR has a six-week summer program that includes:

* In-service professional development (TDI);
* MACILE Summer Academy (MSA)
* Robotics & Simulation (RSP)
* Scholarship program (MSP)
