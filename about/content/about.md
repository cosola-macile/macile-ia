# Body

MACILE, which stands for Mathematics, Sciences, Engineering, and Language in Spanish, is a language-infused STEM (STEM-L) program that advances engineering and science education in less advantaged communities in the USA, the Dominican Republic, and Latin America.

MACILE is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort with faculty and students from USA colleges and universities, Dominican schools, Dominican universities, private corporations, public agencies, professionals, and community leaders. MACILE is a bilingual program. It was piloted in 2007-2008. It is currently a summer program for educators and students and operates in the Itabo-Nigua region, Dominican Republic (MACILE-DR). A pilot program is slated to begin in 2011 in the USA. 

> Learning [math, sciences, and language] processes that enlarge the youths’ thoughts and challenge their imaginations are essential for scientific and technological advancement and indispensable to break through the cycle of poverty—mental, social, and economical—in marginal [less advantaged] communities. Challenging and stimulating education expands the knowledge frontier and elevates hope. 
—SC. Vargas, Executive Director, COSOLA

MACILE is a research driven Education Program. We have published our findings in journals and have presented at various conferences. For a complete list of publications, working papers and conference presentations, visit Complex Systems Optimization Lab.

MACILE-DR is an emerging solutions-driven, language-infused STEM (STEM-L) program operating in the region of Itabo-Nigua (Ytabo) in the Dominican Republic (DR) since 2007. This program, designed to advance K–12 engineering and technology education in the DR, is the first of this nature introduced in the country. It is intended to be a model for fostering design of robust and efficient mathematics, science, engineering and language learning environments.

MACILE is designed as a model system. MACILE programs are tailored to the unique socio-techinical infrastructure differences geography brings. MACILE started in Itabo Dominican Republic and is now extending to the United States.

MACILE-DR is a collaborative multidisciplinary and international effort in partnership with Dominican schools, faculty and students from US colleges and universities, private corporations, and public and private organizations from the US and the Dominican Republic.

MACILE-DR has a six-week summer program that includes:

* In-service professional development (TDI);
* MACILE Summer Academy (MSA)
* Robotics & Simulation (RSP)
* Scholarship program (MSP)

# Objectives 

> “Behind every achievement exists the motivation which is at the foundation of it and which in turn is strengthened and nourished by the accomplishment of the undertaking.” - A. Einstein, 1936

* Research, develop, and improve optimal solutions that increase access to robust STEM-L learning processes and systems in less advantaged (marginal) communities in the US, Dominican Republic, and Latin America* 

* Nurture talented young people from less privileged backgrounds, challenging them to:
	*   be independent thinkers and develop a thirst for knowledge and truth
	*   rise to the highest educational standards, taking pleasure in their work and its results
	*   study and pursue careers in mathematics, science, and engineering
	*   aspire to create opportunities to promote further advances in science, engineering, and technology in their countries
	*   improve sustainability and the quality of human life 
* Create a multilingual knowledge enhancement platform (KEP) to increase access to quality STEM-L resources online Contribute to the development of effective master educators that can lead the way toward continuous improvement in mathematics, science, engineering, and language education
* Provide  opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from the US and Latin America to gain valuable experience in STEM education and research internationally
* Advance teaching in STEM-L

# The System
The MACILE-DR research-based system comprises six main components, which will work together to produce a strong optimal solution for increasing access to robust learning environments and quality STEM-L resources. These components work together to build knowledge and broaden the horizons of talented young people and dedicated educators in the region.

# MACILE-DR Components

* MACILE Summer Academy  (MSA)
* Robotics & Simulation Program  (RSP)
* Teacher Development Institute  (TDI)
* MACILE Scholarship Program (MSP)
* MACILE Preparatory School (MPS)

# MACILE DR Model

The MACILE-DR is a system-based accessibility improvement model. It’s goal is to develop a pipeline of talented young people who are passionate about mathematics, science, engineering, and technology and who are motivated to further their knowledge in these fields, develop careers, and make a difference in their communities.

The model synthesizes research, system analysis, and policy analysis to design and improve robust language-infused STEM (STEM-L) processes and design a system that advances continuous improvement in K–12 STEM education.

MACILE-DR focuses on two critical groups:

* Talented students eager to learn and persevere
* Educators interested in distinguishing themselves as MACILE master teachers and advancing engineering education in their schools

The principal component of the MACILE-DR model is the educational process at the core of which are the educators and the families. The model follows a limited-scale and broad-impact approach to increase access to robust STEM-L learning environments. Accessibility is simulated by an inverted pyramid. Its volume grows dynamically driven by emerging improvements in the learning processes over time, availability of critical STEM-L resources, and improvement of socioeconomic indicators.

# Overview

MACILE is a unique engineering educational program that promotes a learning style that widens windows of opportunities for the children of less advantaged communities. MACILE’s mission is to nurture the talents of these young people by providing them with learning environments that challenge them to have a thirst for understanding and knowing and to rise to the standards of the most prestigious institution of learning in the world. MACILE is committed to develop a talented and empowered student body.

MACILE is a research project that focuses on providing resources in a bilingual format for teachers and students that speak Spanish and English.

MACILE emerges in recognition of the need to make a serious effort to harness the enormous talents existent in poor communities in less developed countries. Developing this wealth of human capital is not only vital to foster scientific and technological development in these countries in the 21st century, but it also fulfills a fundamental human right. Quality education elevates hope.

The program’s structure emphasizes quality to ensure and optimize the multiplicative strength of its teachings under the belief that a small knowledgeable group of people can have the greatest influence in educating their peers. MACILE has five main objectives:

* Encourage and support talented children from Less Advantaged Communities (LAC) to excel in K-12 education and pursue studies and carriers in math, the science, and engineering.
* Build a cadre of master educators that can lead the way toward continuous improvement in Science Technology English Mathematics (STEM) and language education.
* Develop model <abbr title="Science Technology English Mathematics">STEM</abbr> curricula in a multi-language and multi-cultural platform, integrating environmental sustainability and following a system view.
* Contribute to the development of leaders and to improve the quality  of life in the communities.

The program follows COSOLA’s goal of creating a collaborative environment where issues such as lack of education and knowledge are addressed. The program also aims at educating the educators in the hope that they will not only be bettering themselves but also their students.

Currently, MACILE is an intensive and competitive summer program with the goal of establishing a community based environment for children to transform into successful adults, teachers, and leaders. Plans are in place to build a year round school for a full time program while continuing the summer program to include more children in the MACILE community.
