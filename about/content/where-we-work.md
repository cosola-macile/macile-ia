The Itabo-Nigua (Ytabo) Region of the Dominican Republic (DR) lies approximately 20 miles southwest of the nation's capital Santo Domingo.  It includes six towns and houses an estimated student population of approximately 11,800. The median monthly income is less than US$150.  On average, parents have completed through the 5th level of primary school (Survey, 2007).  Less than 50% of students completing 8th grade continue to high school and less than 60% of those entering high school graduate. 

Schools in Itabo suffer from the same problems as many Dominican schools do.  They operate under precarious conditions, lacking not only well prepared math, science, and languages teachers, but also basic needs such as safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation; appropriate school facilities and textbooks; and electricity. Working conditions of the teachers are also difficult. Most work 2-3 shifts per day at one of more schools. They generally teach 4 courses each shift, which often vary per shift and school. Class size ranges between 37 and 60 students. In addition to these conditions, learning at public schools in Ytabo is also impaired by limited parental involvement and growing socio-economic ills (i.e., high unemployment, crime, HIV/AID, drugs, alcoholism, and noise) affecting the communities (2007 survey).

Students in Itabo urgently need access to better educational environments, improved teaching, and programs that stimulate their imaginations, broaden their horizons, and provide opportunities for them to learn and succeed.

## Education in the Dominican Republic

Quality education in the Dominican Republic is available only to a privileged few. Most K-12 students attend overcrowded public schools that can afford to keep them for only a few hours a day. In fact, the effective school day in the Dominican Republic amount to less than 3 hours. The schools are further plagued by under-prepared teachers, lack of educational resources and inadequate facilities. The university system fares no better; a proliferation of private universities that are not too expensive for less advantaged students, and, save a few, lack competitive science and technological programs. While public universities lack the resources to develop high-quality, competitive science and technology programs.

Parents of limited means send their children to affordable private schools due to the condition of public education. As a result, private schools are numerous in the Dominican Republic, but with the exception of a few elite schools, the majority of them, particularly those located in poor communities, operate under similar limitations as the public schools. Students attending these schools do not perform significantly better in math, science, and language.

Clearly, the quality of education received by disadvantaged students is low no matter what school they attend. There is a great deal of work that remains to be done to increase math, science, and language performance at the K–12 level.

By teaching children skills and confidence early in their education, COSOLA hopes to contribute to improve education at all levels in the Dominican Republic.COSOLA Mission

To work to improve this situation, COSOLA has developed three primary goals:

create a model to cost-effectively deliver top-quality preparatory elementary and secondary education through the MACILE program help improve science, math, and language education in the K–12 schools of less-advantaged communities
help students from least advantaged strata to gain access to top universities and pursue degrees in math, science, and technology, thereby creating educators and leaders who can improve the quality of their schools and communities
create a foundation and tradition of technological and scientific research in the Dominican Republic
The first step toward these goals is COSOLA's project: MACILE-Ytabo.

# Why MACILE Ytabo?

The most significant constraint to sustainable economic development, as well as scientific and technological advancement in the Dominican Republic (DR), is the persistent low skills in mathematics, science, and language of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. These are the majority of young people population in the country. They live in marginal communities where the educational infrastructures are still basic; challenging and stimulating classrooms (public or private) are rare; and access to any education is still limited for many school age children.

The design and improvement of robust language-infused STEM (STEM-L)  processes and systems is essential for cultivating the vast wealth of creativity and imagination abundant in the less privileged communities and reducing this constraing. Motivating young people from these backgrounds to learn mathematics, science, engineering, and language and to aspire to reach their highest potential will generate continuous educational advancement in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and other fields of learning at all levels over time.


In the DR, according to multiple national and international reports, after decades of reforms, less than 50% of youth age 14–17 has access to public schools and increased access to elementary education has been achieved by reducing the effective school day to under 3 hours/day. In 2008,  65.5% of 15–19 years olds had completed 8th grade or beyond and less than 60% of those enrolled graduated from high school.  At the same time, the DR has to be innovative players to achieve sustainable economic expansion in the renewable-energy–based global economy of the 21st century. An unachievable objective without increasing their capacity for cultivating the vast wealth of creativity and imagination abundant in less privileged communities

The MACILE experience in the DR since 2007 shows that young people and teachers from disadvantaged backgrounds are eager to learn and to participate in the emergence of the country as an innovative actor in the global economy. When students are immersed in robust, inquiry-driven learning environments that challenge their imagination and creativity, even for relatively short periods, they can improve their mathematics, science, and language skills. These environments also spur an interest in mathematics, science, and engineering.

# Education in the DR

A review of the Dominican public education system provides a problematic outlook. Public K-12 schools place at the bottom of the quality scale nationally and internationally. A handful of elite private schools provide quality K-12 education for the privileged few that can afford the high tuition and fees. However, most private schools do not provide any better education than the public schools.

Unlike in the USA, where multiple well-designed math and science standards are available and significant resources are invested to improve STEM curricula, the Dominican Republic lack clear math and science standards. There are no expectations for technology education in k-12.  The DR devotes few resources toward the development of standards or quality curricula. Far reaching educational reforms adopted since the 1980s show willingness to import ideas and curricula from the USA, Europe, and Asia; however, they have not produced the intended results. The country is still struggling to define its own vision for science and technology. Its budget for research and development is dismal as is the education budget. Indeed, the overall educational
budget in the DR has never been higher than 2.7% of GDP in any period. Education research has been marginal.


The reforms have also failed with respect to access to public schools. While accessibility for children age 6-13 has increased substantially over the past 15 years (91% enrolment), that for 14-17 years old has remained relatively low (36.5%). Increased access to elementary education has been achieved by reducing the school day. Schools operate 2 to 3 short shifts daily, reducing the effective school day to about 3 hours without decreasing crowdedness. These conditions and ineffective teachers have increased desertion and child labor. In 2005, 65.5% of 15-19 years olds had completed 8th grade or beyond and less than 60% of those enrolled graduated from high school. In rural areas and marginal communities like Ytabo the high school graduation rate
remains less than 50%.

# Why MACILE Itabo

First, in the Dominican Republic the educational infrastructure is basic. Educational models that require significant advances in science and continuous engineering are required for a twenty-first century workforce and the movement towards sustainable development in the global economy, .

Second, the recovery and development of human potential wealth available in less developed communities is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development in the XXI century. This condition is especially critical for the Dominican Republic to allow the country to emerge as an innovative and creative country in the twenty-first century global economy.
