The Itabo-Nigua (Ytabo) Region of the Dominican Republic (DR) lies approximately 20 miles southwest of the nation's capital Santo Domingo.  It includes six towns and houses an estimated student population of approximately 11,800. The median monthly income is less than US$150.  On average, parents have completed through the 5th level of primary school (Survey, 2007).  Less than 50% of students completing 8th grade continue to high school and less than 60% of those entering high school graduate. 

Schools in Itabo suffer from the same problems as many Dominican schools do.  They operate under precarious conditions, lacking not only well prepared math, science, and languages teachers, but also basic needs such as safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation; appropriate school facilities and textbooks; and electricity. Working conditions of the teachers are also difficult. Most work 2-3 shifts per day at one of more schools. They generally teach 4 courses each shift, which often vary per shift and school. Class size ranges between 37 and 60 students. In addition to these conditions, learning at public schools in Ytabo is also impaired by limited parental involvement and growing socio-economic ills (i.e., high unemployment, crime, HIV/AID, drugs, alcoholism, and noise) affecting the communities (2007 survey).

Students in Itabo urgently need access to better educational environments, improved teaching, and programs that stimulate their imaginations, broaden their horizons, and provide opportunities for them to learn and succeed.

## Education in the Dominican Republic

Quality education in the Dominican Republic is available only to a privileged few. Most K-12 students attend overcrowded public schools that can afford to keep them for only a few hours a day. In fact, the effective school day in the Dominican Republic amount to less than 3 hours. The schools are further plagued by under-prepared teachers, lack of educational resources and inadequate facilities. The university system fares no better; a proliferation of private universities that are not too expensive for less advantaged students, and, save a few, lack competitive science and technological programs. While public universities lack the resources to develop high-quality, competitive science and technology programs.

Parents of limited means send their children to affordable private schools due to the condition of public education. As a result, private schools are numerous in the Dominican Republic, but with the exception of a few elite schools, the majority of them, particularly those located in poor communities, operate under similar limitations as the public schools. Students attending these schools do not perform significantly better in math, science, and language.

Clearly, the quality of education received by disadvantaged students is low no matter what school they attend. There is a great deal of work that remains to be done to increase math, science, and language performance at the K–12 level.

By teaching children skills and confidence early in their education, COSOLA hopes to contribute to improve education at all levels in the Dominican Republic.COSOLA Mission

To work to improve this situation, COSOLA has developed three primary goals:

create a model to cost-effectively deliver top-quality preparatory elementary and secondary education through the MACILE program
help improve science, math, and language education in the K–12 schools of less-advantaged communities
help students from least advantaged strata to gain access to top universities and pursue degrees in math, science, and technology, thereby creating educators and leaders who can improve the quality of their schools and communities
create a foundation and tradition of technological and scientific research in the Dominican Republic
The first step toward these goals is COSOLA's project: MACILE-Ytabo.
