# 2009

We continued to focus on curricula development, quality improvement, and increasing the number of schools participating (which went from 2 in 2007 to 4 in 2008 and 7 in 2009).

We established a collaborative agreement with the Technology and Engineering Education (TEE) Program at the School of Engineering at Brigham Young University (BYU) to develop the technology and engineering program for Dominican students and teachers. We also establishied a collaborative agreement with the leading technological university in the Dominican Republic, Instituto Technol√≥gico Dominicano (INTEC).

Fifty-four students, from grade 6 to 11 and ages 11 to 17, were admitted and participated.
