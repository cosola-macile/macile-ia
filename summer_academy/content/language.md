The main objective of the Spanish curriculum is to improve mastery of the language, including grammatical structure and orthography, critical reading skills, and analytical writing skills. Contrary to common practices, these concepts are woven into the curriculum, but are not their main focus. Students are immersed instead into exploring Dominican history (starting with the roots: Indigenous, European, and African), culture, and literature, using native texts. They also learn about the Latin American culture and its relationship to their own. They learn philosophical views and ideas of individuals that have shaped their society.

This approach has been highly effective at motivating students and teachersâ€™ to learn and to be creative (see testimonials). 

The English curriculum exploit well-designed and proven online-based and self-guided programs to help students master the fundamentals of the language. The reading program is highly focused on developing students understanding of the nature of science, engineering, and technology as they master the English language.

The language curriculum inspired the narrative-driven focus of the MACILE STEM curricula. Language tools are woven into the STEM curricula to enhance teaching and infuse learning by motivating the students imagination and creativity; thus the term.
