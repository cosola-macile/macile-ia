## REP Main Goals

(1) Provide students with opportunities to understand the scientific process, engineering problem-solving and the application of technology; understanding how technological systems work with other systems; use mathematical knowledge and skills in solving problems; communicate results effectively through writing and verbally, and work effectively with others, increase learners’ awareness about the natural environment and roles that engineers and scientists can play at improving it and advancing humanity through innovation and conservation.

(2) Train teachers to be research mentors, able to guide the inquiry process as the students work in the projects.

Projects can address a wide range of problems and a wide range of fields – energy, environment, manufacturing, garbage, automation and

robotics, water quality – that can be of interest to Ytabo or the Dominican Republic. Projects instill a desire within the students to discover how things work and help them develop proper experiments, and problem solving.
