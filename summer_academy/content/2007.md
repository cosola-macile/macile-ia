# 2007

In its first year, MACILE Summer Academy lasted three weeks and included only mathematics. Sixty-four students, ranging from grade 7 to 10 and from age 11 to 54 participated. 

The MACILE Summer Academy 2007 was possible due to the generous support of Buffalo Tungsten, a private corporation based in Buffalo, NY; and with the cooperation of the Ytabo public school, Hainaâ€™s public school district, the local chapter of the Lion Club, and local community members and teachers.
