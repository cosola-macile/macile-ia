# 2010

The curricula design, number of schools participating, selectivity, and collaborative efforts continued to advance.Seventy-six out of 152 students were selected to participate. These came from nineteen public and private schools from Ytabo and other towns and cities . The program for Grades 6-10 includes courses and activities in mathematics, engineering & technology, and language (Spanish). For more advanced high school students (grade 9-12) the program included robotics, science, and mathematics 

The Robotic & Simulation program began in summer 2010. Sixteen students in grades 10–12 from six public high schools from Haina-Nigua, San Cristóbal, and Santo Domingo participated in the 5-week program. US undergraduate students from the Technology and Engineering Education Program at Brigham young University supervised by TEE faculty taught the program.

At the end of the program, Dominican students demonstrated their skills with a robot warfare competition.  Satisfaction with the robotics class was absolute. We hope to be able to offer two Robotics & Simulation classes in summer 2011 and increase the number of students benefiting from this program to 32 or 40.
