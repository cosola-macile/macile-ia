# Body
The engineering and technology curriculum follows knowledge-building, hands-on strategies, including activities, experiments, and research that explore a wide range of fundamental concepts, research innovations, and technologies. The goal is to ignite students’ curiosity for engineering and technology and to motivate them to explore and be inventive. Another important goal of the curriculum is to clarify misconceptions about engineering, engineers, and technology.

The students’ interest in engineering and technology increases as they internalize the engineering design process, connect the concept of technology to their own lives and the environment, develop appreciation for mathematics and science as they relate to engineering and technology, and gain understanding of the concept of ethics in regard to scientific and technological processes and discoveries.

## Objectives.

* First, develop student knowledge of the design process (problem solving) in engineering.
* Second, ignite curiosity in students in engineering and technology and motivate students to explore and invent alternatives
* Third, internalize the concept of technology in relation to the individual and the environment
* Fourth, develop students appreciation for math-science-related technology
* Finally, instill the concept of ethics in regard to scientific and technological processes
