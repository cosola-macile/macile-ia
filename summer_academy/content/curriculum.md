The MACILE STEM curricula integrate tools of language to enhance learning and cultivate the studentsâ€™ imagination and creativity. The language-infused STEM curricula (STEM-L) emphasize problem solving, using the engineering design process as the model for motivating reasoning and creativity. Other emphases are:

* strengthening teamwork
* improving communication skills
* developing experimentation skills
* building capacity for independent learning
* building awareness about environmental and economic sustainability

Our strategy harnesses the wealth of well-designed research-based STEM curricula resources and standards available in the US and other countries. Ultimately, the MACILE curricula are designed to meet our objectives and determined needs.These are improved and refined through extensive classroom-based research. The development process has a multidisciplinary focus, featuring the interactions among STEM fields and between these and language.
