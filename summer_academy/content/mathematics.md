The Active Mathematics curriculum emphasizes incremental learning through continuous practice and aims to build the students’ problem solving skills. The curriculum features the concept of the tool box and the network of tools that grow gradually with each lesson. Another feature is the integration of the engineering design process to improve problem solving.

The lessons and problems are designed or modified to help the students master mathematical fundamentals, learn to put logic and reasoning to work, recognize patterns, gain understanding of the network structure inside the box (the tools network), and develop confidence using the tools.  Through application problems students gain appreciation of how mathematics connects to other fields or disciplines (chemistry, physics, biology, engineering), as well as everyday life.
Main Objectives

* Improve student mastery of basic mathematical foundations
* Instruct students in the process of mathematical problem solving, connecting concepts, recognizing patterns and manipulating mechanisms
* Make the learning process interesting and motivating.
