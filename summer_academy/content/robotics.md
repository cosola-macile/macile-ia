The RS program promotes the development of a technological literate workforce for the 21st century challenging talented high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds in the Dominican Republic to get excited about sustainability, technology and engineering with LEGO Robotics and simulation modeling techniques 

# Body
Robots have long captured the imagination of young people, researchers, and writers, and robotic systems have a wide range of applications in modern technology—manufacturing, space exploration, warfare, health care, transportation, oceanography, environmental science, education, energy, and more. Soon robotic systems will be ubiquitous in most aspects of human life.

Simulation is the perfect tool for studying all kind of systems and processes, building understanding about their structures and dynamics, and discovering solutions for complex problems.  

MACILE Robotics and Simulation Program (RSP), is designed to excite students about science, technology and engineering to advance the development of a technological literate workforce for the 21st century. Three-year pilot started in 2010

The robotics curriculum is LEGO based. The simulation curriculum involves discrete process modeling, systems dynamic, and other techniques. Students work in small teams under the mentorship of college students, teachers, or professionals knowledgeable in the field.

Teams participate in a science and technology conference and competitions structured to challenge their creativity, enhance their critical thinking, and strengthen collaborative work. Each team applies what they learned to produce solutions to actual engineering challenges. The work enhances understanding of theoretical principals of engineering, physics, chemistry, math, and technology, and strengthens their communication and experimental skills. 

# The Curriculum and Objectives

The main objective is to immerse students in the understanding of systems and processes, their structure and dynamics, using robotics and simulation.

The curriculum includes a series of activities designed to introduce participants to the many aspects of robotics and immerse them in the world of technology. The courses also introduce students to simulation and its applications to many real world problems. The curriculum synthesizes STEM-L and brings the students experience with concepts from computer science, systems engineering, simulation modeling, design, systems dynamic, environmental engineering, urban planning, and reliability.

The robotics curriculum is LEGO based. The simulation curriculum involves discrete process modeling, systems dynamic, discrete simulation modeling, mapping, planning and design, and other techniques.

Curriculum
Robotics & Simulation I

Infused with STEM-L fundamentals, Robotics I provides a basic understanding of robotic operation and preliminary experience in the design and use of robots. Students learn programming and get into the world of technology, exploring the works of scientists, engineers, and inventors who develop technology and conceive advancements. Students also explore the creation of technology through the forward-looking lenses of science fiction.

Teams showcase their creativity, problem solving skills, and teamwork during the science and technology conference. Their work brings into focus their understanding of basic principles of engineering and robotics, mathematics, geometry, design, programming, and technology in general.
Robotics & Simulation II

Robotics II builds on what students learned in Robotics & Simulation I. Students gain fundamental knowledge and information on robotic manipulators, structures, systems, and related applications. Robotics & Simulation II strengthens the students’ mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, technology, communication, and experimental skills.

Students work in small teams to design, construct, and program working robots that accomplish functions and tasks they design. The teams will also create simulation models of systems or processes to study their dynamics and to experiment engineering solutions to a wide range of socio-technical and environmental problems affecting countries and communities.

Robotics projects will address aspects of intelligent robotics such as mobile walking robots, robotic vision, and robotic speech as well as the design and applications of robots for hazardous tasks and environments. Along the way students will learn about materials, logistics, mechanical stress, design strategies, design and analysis of experiments, and other topics that will give them a grasp of the interactions of science, engineering, technology, and society.

Competitions challenge creativity, critical thinking, and collaborative work. Each team applies what it learned to produce solutions to actual engineering challenges. Their work will bring into focus their understanding of relevant theoretical STEM, as well as their communication skills.
