Robots have long captured the imagination of young people, researchers, and writers, and robotic systems have a wide range of applications in modern technologyâ€”manufacturing, space exploration, warfare, health care, transportation, oceanography, environmental science, education, energy, and more. Soon robotic systems will be ubiquitous in most aspects of human life.

Simulation is the perfect tool for studying all kind of systems and processes, building understanding about their structures and dynamics, and discovering solutions for complex problems.  

MACILE Robotics and Simulation Program (RSP), is designed to excite students about science, technology and engineering to advance the development of a technological literate workforce for the 21st century. Three-year pilot started in 2010

The robotics curriculum is LEGO based. The simulation curriculum involves discrete process modeling, systems dynamic, and other techniques. Students work in small teams under the mentorship of college students, teachers, or professionals knowledgeable in the field.

Teams participate in a science and technology conference and competitions structured to challenge their creativity, enhance their critical thinking, and strengthen collaborative work. Each team applies what they learned to produce solutions to actual engineering challenges. The work enhances understanding of theoretical principals of engineering, physics, chemistry, math, and technology, and strengthens their communication and experimental skills.
