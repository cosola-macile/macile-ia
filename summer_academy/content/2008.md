The program was redesigned based on the information obtained during the first summer and the research conducted that year. Changes included extending the program to five weeks and adding science and technology, Spanish language, and activities (field trips, mentoring, speakers, games) to the curriculum. The MACILE curricular philosophy started to emerge with the development of the Spanish and mathematics curricula.
Recommendation and selection procedures were developed and implemented. Thirty-five out of 80 recommended students, from grades 6 to 10 and ages 12 to 17, were admitted.
