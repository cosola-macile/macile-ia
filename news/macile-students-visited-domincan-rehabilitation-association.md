 MACILE students visited the facilities of the 
 Association Dominicana de Rehabilitación (Domincan Rehabilitation Association)
(www.adr.org.do) in Santo Domingo. The group included advanced students from 
the summer academy, MACILE college students, BYU students, 
BYU professor Dr. Ron Terry, and COSOLA director Dr. SC. Vargas. 
The tour was arranged in collaboration with Dr. Carlos A. Zometa, ADR Senior 
Advisor for the International Programs Office. This visit was arranged as 
part of the summer curricula for the advanced high school class, which included 
biomedical engineering. During the visit, the students listened to a talk 
from Dr. Zometa and several area leaders who spoke about the history of the 
Association, the populations they serve, the services they offer, and about 
the Dominican Republic’s need for these services. In addition, students 
learned about opportunities for employment in fields relevant to the 
Association’s project, including but not limited to: special education, 
biomedical engineering, physical therapy, psychology, psychiatry, orthopedics, 
and pediatrics. Following the lecture, students took a tour of the facilities 
that allowed them to observe its work in progress. The departments they toured 
included: proterics, shoe manufacturing, wheelchair construction, special 
education, rehabilitation, and physical therapy. Students were granted the 
invaluable opportunity to interact and conduct interviews with patients 
in the waiting areas. It was a truly remarkable experience for all, but particularly 
for the Dominican students, who were previously unaware of the Association and 
the invaluable services it provides to the Dominican society.
