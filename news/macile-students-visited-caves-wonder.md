 MACILE high school students, TEE-BYU team, and MACILE faculty visited 
 Cueva de las Maravillas (The Cave of Wonders), closing the 2012 session of 
 the MACILE Summer Academy with a golden brooch. Cueva de las Maravillas is a 
 museum of cave art inside rock formations that date back 100,000 years, 
 and field trips to places such as this are integral elements of the 
 MACILE curricula. This trip was a marvelous experience for all who attended.
