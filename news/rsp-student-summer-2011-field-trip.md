## High School Students Travel to Santiago

For the end of the Summer 2010 MACILE RSP session the students took a trip to the Santiago de los Caballeros, the second largest city in the Dominican Republic.  

The students visited the Centro Leon museum followed by lunch at the famous Parqué Colón located in the center of the old post-colonial city of Santiago. 

The field trip culminated with an excursion to the top of the The Monument in Santiago.
