 MACILE students from grades 6 through 8 concluded the 2012 session of 
 MACILE Summer Academy with visits to both the childrenâ€™s museum, 
 Museo Infantil Trampolin (www.trampolin.org.do), and the 
 Museo de las Casas Reales (www.cultura.gov.do). These museums teach their 
 visitors about scientific history, Dominican history, and Dominican culture, 
 making this field trip a wonderful compliment to both science and Spanish 
 classes taken by the students.
