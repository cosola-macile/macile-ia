Provides needed support and networking for MACILE students through a series of services: mentor program, guidance counselor, tutoring resources, scholarships and internships information, and other resources or opportunities available for students in the country and abroad. These services are essential to build the studentsâ€™ confidence, broaden their horizons, and encourage them to remain focused in their educational goals. Given the socio-economic conditions of the families and the communities as well as the reality of the Dominican education system, a mentoring and guidance program is a necessity for greater effectiveness.
