# The objective

In addition to the MSTEM-RNet, MACILE-DR plans to develop an extensive library for teachers and students. It currently has about 400 volumes and reference materials, which are accessible to MACILE teachers and students during the summer. The physical library will be housed at the MACILE Preparatory School and will be accessible to all teachers and young people who desire to learn.

The MACILE Library program will address a very important need. As with most of the country, there are no public or private libraries in any of the towns comprising the Itabo-Nigua region or in any of the neighboring towns. Public school libraries are very poor, and are libraries in name only. The public library is in Santo Domingo, thus difficult to access, and is not designed to inspire young peopleâ€™s curiosity and desire to inquiry.

We believe the MACILE-DR library will be an invaluable asset to the communities.
