# Teaser About TDI
TDI provides development opportunities in language-infused STEM (STEM-L) education for educators from less advantaged communities

# Body

The mission of the Teacher Development Institute (TDI) is to provide development opportunities for educators from less advantaged communities who are interested in distinguishing themselves as MACILE master teachers and in advancing language-infused STEM (STEM-L) education in their schools. It is a multidisciplinary collaborative international initiative.

Piloted in 2008, the summer institute has enrolled, on average, 18 in-service educators each year since inception. In addition, over 100 educators have participated in the seminar and workshop series. The pilot phase of the academic year program will begin in 2012, if funding is available.  This program will improve the capacity of many in-service and pre-service educators each year.

The broader impact of TDI will emerge over time from:

* improvement in teaching and learning
* an increase in the number of master MACILE educators involved in training and mentoring in-service and new teachers
* an increase in understanding of quality STEM-L education
* increased access to more effective STEM-L curricula and resources.  

TDI Comprises:

* Summer Institute
* Academic Year Program
* Seminar and Workshop Series
* Knowledge Enhancement Program (KEP)

# Summer Institute

The summer institute offers one- to two-week intensive courses in mathematics, engineering and technology education,  the structure of Spanish through history and culture, and active experimental science.

These standards-based courses have been developed and taught by US university professors and follow MACILE curricular philosophy and the program objectives. Dominican educators are expected to engage directly in the curriculum development process and assume the leadership of the Summer Institute in the future.
