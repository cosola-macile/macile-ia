Thanks to generosity of our supporters, we are able to continue to offer TDI Session for free. We suggest a small contribution of RD$300 to help us cover our cost. Admisson and participation are not dependent on teachers ability to pay. 

We'd also like to thank Colegio Padre Zegri for their continued generosity and support by donating their facilities for MACILE programs.
