 TDI offered a mathematics workshop for teacher from June 20-24. The mathematics workshop, “Math for Activity-Based Learning,” was taught by Professor SC. Vargas, Ph.D., and held at the Centro Educativo Padre Zegri in Nigua. This workshop focused on strategies to integrate activities into the curriculum that improve reasoning and enhance understanding of concepts. While all teachers were welcome to attend, the workshop was primarily oriented toward teachers teaching 3rd-6th grade math. Six teachers attended. Each school represented received one kit of learning materials.
