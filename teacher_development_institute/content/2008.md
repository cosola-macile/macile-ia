In 2008, a teacher development program was established with an objective to prepare teachers who assist in the MACILE classrooms and the local schools. Teacher motivation was the main challenge in organizing the workshops. Teachers were involved in a one-week Spanish workshop and a three-week elementary mathematics workshop for 3rd to 6th grade teachers. Teachers are reluctant to compromise their summers even when they recognize their skill limitations, which is understandable given the difficult work conditions. Eleven teachers participated, including two working with MACILE. 

Weakness in the teachers' mathematics and language abilities are severe. With one exception, teachers participating in the workshops did not have a fluid sense of how to combine numbers, manipulate fractions, select tools to solve problems and manipulate large numbers. They have difficulties solving simple mathematics problems mentally and using paper and pencil. Most teachers also have difficulties with critical and analytical reading and writing. Observations of some classrooms showed similar patterns. Teachers taught by the textbook and were uncomfortable with the materials. They emphasized passive memorization and showed poor classroom management skills.
