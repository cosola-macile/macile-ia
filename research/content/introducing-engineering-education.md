This work considers a model to introduce engineering education in K–12 classrooms in a less advantaged region— Hitabo-Nigua (Ytabo)— in the Dominican Republic. MACILE-Ytabo started a two year pilot summer program in 2007. This work analyzes the first two years of the MACILE-Ytabo experience to evaluate whether the program has been successful at increasing participants’ interest in mathematics, sciences and engineering and to understand challenges that must be overcome to effectively introduce engineering education in K–12 classrooms in Ytabo. We evaluate learner performance, teacher participation and participants’ satisfaction with the program. Finally, we propose a model to accomplish the goal in the target region. MACILE is a novel effort. We are not aware of any other program specifically designed to advance science and engineering education in K–12 classrooms in the Dominican Republic.
