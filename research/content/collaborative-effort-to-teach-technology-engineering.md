This paper will report on the joint efforts of Complex Systems Optimization Lab (COSOLA) and
Technology and Engineering Education (TEE) Program at Brigham Young University (BYU) to
provide summer program to teach technology and engineering topics to middle school and high
school students in the Dominican Republic. During the activities, we used material developed by the Engineering is Elementary program at he Boston Museum of Science. The Dominican Republic students and faculty were very engaged and enjoyed the learning experience in spite of challenging language differences. We will describe on the activities conducted, the challenges in presenting the material, and how the material was received and understood by the participating teachers and students.
