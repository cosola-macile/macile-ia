This paper contains a report of the ongoing, collaborative effort between Complex Systems Optimization Lab (COSOLA) and the Technology and Engineering Education (TEE) Program at Brigham Young University (BYU) to design a science and technology program to improve Dominican student academic knowledge and skills. In 2007, COSOLA instituted the Matemáticas, Ciencias, Ingeniería y Lenguaje or Mathematics, Sciences, Engineering, and Language (MACILE) education program to help advance engineering and science education in less advantaged communities in the Dominican Republic (DR). The summer program was piloted in 2007 and 2008. TEE became involved in 2009. Eight of our university students spent 5 weeks during the summer of 2010 in the Dominican Republic teaching 6th -12th grade students. Under the supervision of three university faculty members, the university students developed the curriculum during spring term and then presented the material during summer term. The Dominican Republic students were assessed as to their learning and satisfaction with the instruction. The university students were assessed as to the effect that the study abroad had on their teacher development. This paper contains a report of the curriculum development, the study abroad activities, and a summary of the assessment results of both the Dominican Republic students and our university students. The full text of this article is available through the ASEE.
